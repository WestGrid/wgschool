1. instructor / helpers / course introduction
1. distribute usernames and passwords (optional, only for quick Plotly practice)
1. slides for this course
1. let's try to start ParaView on your computer
1. review the program for today
1. share the afternoon exercises: pay attention to the slides that say *"Exercise"* in the title

Almost 1h55m of videos to watch today!

Plotly is a **side topic** to show some interactive visualizations where ParaView is an overkill. Please
do not spend more than 30 mins on it, or you will have no time left for 3D visualization!

Today for practice you can use Plotly on:

1. your machine -- install it locally if you know how
1. on Cassiopeia training cluster (described in the video)
1. on *westgrid.syzygy.ca* from yesterday's Jupyter course; Plotly library is installed there!

By the end of the day you should be comfortable with:

* running ParaView and displaying Source objects
* importing datasets into ParaView
* applying filters to process data

<!-- - creating and deleting files and directories, copying and moving them -->
<!-- - writing text into a file and printing its contents to the terminal -->
<!-- - working with `tar` archives -->
