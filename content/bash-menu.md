This is a **2-day** hands-on introduction to the Linux command line and the interaction with a remote
server. This course mixes [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org) materials with WestGrid's
custom training.

**Instructor**: Alex Razoumov (WestGrid)

**Level**: beginner

**Prerequisites**: This is an introductory course, no previous experience is required. We will provide
guest accounts to one of our Linux systems.

**Software**: All attendees will need a remote secure shell (SSH) client installed on their computer in
order to participate in the course exercises. On Windows we recommend
[the free Home Edition of MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html). On Mac and Linux
computers SSH is usually pre-installed (try typing `ssh` in a terminal to make sure it is there).

<!-- * online reading and videos -->
<!-- - most of this time: watching pre-recorded videos and doing exercises on their own -->
