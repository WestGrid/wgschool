This **2-day** course is an introduction to High-Performance Computing on Compute Canada clusters. Please
download a [ZIP file](https://owncloud.westgrid.ca/index.php/s/VCD8Pogqmk7eS16/download) with all slides
(single PDF combining all chapters) and sample codes.

**Instructor**: Alex Razoumov (WestGrid)

**Level**: beginner

**Prerequisites**: Working knowledge of the Linux command line
([covered in bash course](../bash-menu)). We will provide guest accounts to one of our Linux systems.

**Laptop software**: All attendees will need a remote secure shell (SSH) client installed. On Windows
laptops we recommend
[the free Home Edition of MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html). On Mac and Linux
laptops SSH is usually pre-installed (try typing `ssh` in a terminal to make sure it is there).
