**Instructor**: Ian Allison (PIMS)

This **1-day** course will introduce researchers to Jupyter notebooks as a tool for conducting research
and for communicating their work.

The Jupyter ecosystem is a rich environment for interactive computing which provides intuitive and
powerful tools for data-analysis, computation and collaboration. We will explore the features of the
Jupyter notebook and the Python programming language. Specifically, we will look at:

- notebook cells: markdown, code, output
- Python syntax: structures, loops, control flow, logic

We will then use some popular Python packages (Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Sympy, etc) to work through a series
of examples and exercises to see how they can be used to work with external data sources, produce
insights and visualizations and help create compelling showcases of your work.

**Target audience**: general

**Level**: beginner

**Prerequisites**: You will need a [GitHub](https://github.com) account for this course. Also, please
