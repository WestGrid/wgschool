This is a **1-day** course.

**Instructor**: Jacob Boschee (UBC)

<!-- **Course plan**: -->

**Target audience**: general

**Level**: beginner

**Prerequisites**: [Introduction to Compute Canada cloud](../cloud) course

We will be running Docker inside virtual machines (VMs) in Compute Canada cloud, so you must be familiar
with setting up a blank Ubuntu server in a cloud VM before attending this course.

**Software**: All attendees will need a remote secure shell (SSH) client installed on their computer in
order to participate in the course exercises. On Windows we recommend
[the free Home Edition of MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html). On Mac and Linux
computers SSH is usually pre-installed (try typing `ssh` in a terminal to make sure it is there).
