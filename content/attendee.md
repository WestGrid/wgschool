## Registration

<!-- Free Eventbrite registration for individual courses will open to participants from all WestGrid -->
<!-- institutions in early May. -->

Please register using
[this page](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/westgrid-research-computing-summer-school-2020-online-tickets-102614093516),
with your **institutional email address** (not a personal/gmail account -- we will only be sending the
Zoom session details to institutional emails). Researchers, students, and staff members at Canadian
post-secondary institutions and other research organizations can register for our school. Researchers of
all disciplines and skill levels are welcome to participate.

Some courses may require some pre-requisite knowledge. Please see the notes below and check the course
descriptions in the program for more details. Note that the course materials are still developed and will
be completed in time for each course.

<!-- <\!-- Note: If you are an international researcher / student living outside of Canada and you have no relation -\-> -->
<!-- <\!-- to a Canadian post-secondary institution, then you cannot register; however, you are welcome to browse -\-> -->
<!-- <\!-- WestGrid's Training Materials website for similar resources and recorded videos. -\-> -->

## Format

In many courses, the format will be self-paced learning (mix of reading materials, pre-recorded videos,
takeaway exercises) and live Zoom sessions with the instructors. To simplify logistics, we will not have
parallel courses -- everything will be in a single track. Few most popular courses will repeat towards
the end (to be scheduled later, based on the registration numbers).

Online learning will be accompanied by short (1-1.5 hours) hands-on Zoom sessions; their number and
length will be determined by each instructor. Note that our Zoom sessions will be limited to 100
participants. We do not expect more than 100 actual attendees in any single session, however, to be on
the safe side, we suggest logging in a little bit early. The room number and password of each Zoom
session will be emailed to all registrants (**institutional Canadian emails only**) in each
course. Before each Zoom session, all participants must read/watch the required materials. In Zoom
sessions we will guide participants through a series of hands-on exercises based on the reviewed
material.

Several courses will not follow this format and will be live Zoom lectures without any pre-recorded
content.

A base-level knowledge of Linux is required for all courses, and this can be achieved by attending the
[Bash course](../bash-menu) in Week 1.

#### Time zone

Please note that all live Zoom session times follow the **Pacific Daylight Time** or UTC-07:00.

#### Cluster accounts

All academic participants are encouraged (but not required) to obtain a Compute Canada account. To
register for a free Compute Canada account,
[click here](https://ccdb.computecanada.ca/account_application). We will also be providing guest
accounts.

#### Tips for using Zoom

We suggest that all participants use a dual-screen setup if possible: presenter's materials on one
screen, your workspace on another. We also suggest to use a good headset/microphone and to mute yourself
during sessions unless asking a question.

<!-- - tracking attendance: type your name + some small tidbit into the etherpad (or similar), or use socrative with names -->
<!-- - will not be recorded -->

#### Software debugging sessions

Please note that we will NOT be debugging software installations during the actual Zoom sessions as this
will be done in special debugging sessions: several on Monday May-25, and a number of software debugging
sessions for selected courses. If you require assistance with software, please consider attending a
debugging session, but please be prepared to share your screen with the problem: it will help us help you
and help others with similar issues. Once again, these debugging sessions are not considered part of any
course, and only participants with technical difficulties should attend them.

## Certificates

We will issue certificates listing the courses each participant has attended in full. A course is
considered attended in full when a participant attends and participates in all exercises in all Zoom
sessions in that course (debugging sessions do not count).
