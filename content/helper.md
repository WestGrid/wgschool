Some Zoom sessions might have close to 100 attendees (our current limit), and weâ€™ll need helpers!!!
Please consider adding your name to the [helpers document](https://bit.ly/3cjvRWc) along with a couple of
courses you can help with. And if you know someone who could be a helper, please forward this link to
them.

For the times of the Zoom sessions, courses that rely mostly on pre-recorded materials will have a
shorter 9am (Pacific) Zoom session and a longer 2pm (Pacific) one. Courses that deliver most materials
live will likely have one 3-4 hour Zoom session per day starting in the morning.

In each session, we are thinking of organizing multiple breakout room mini-sessions, with one helper per
room, between the main sessions, so we need as many helpers as we can get.

The week before the school we are planning to have a Zoom session with all helpers, to get familiar with
the workflow.

Many thanks!!!
