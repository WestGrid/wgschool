Check [the bash course](../bash-menu) to see the timing example. Here we have 4-5 hours of live in-person
lectures converted to 2.5 hours of pre-recorded videos and eventually to two days in the online summer
school.

[Let us know](mailto:training@westgrid.ca) if you need a cluster reservation and/or guest accounts on
Cedar or Graham. By default we are not creating these. All WestGrid Central courses will use a dedicated
6-node (2 cores, 3GB per node) virtual training cluster on Arbutus.

In live Zoom sessions, if we have many participants (more than ~20; in some sessions we might have up to
100 participants which is our current limit in the Zoom Pro plan), we might not be able to debug
everyone's problems. The goal is to try our best to debug the most common / important problems and share
the solutions with all participants. In WestGrid Central courses we will be using
[Socrative](https://socrative.com) to set 10-15 checkpoints per session at which participants will be
invited to provide information on their problems or lack thereof. We will be using Socrative also for
quizzes and to track attendance and participant engagement.

In other words, we encourage you to structure your Zoom sessions in such a way that there is a feedback
loop to allow large-scale problem debugging. If we have several helpers, you might also want to use
Zoom's breakout rooms feature.

If you expect problem with software installation, please consider scheduling a separate software
installation session before your course starts.

Finally, please [let us know](mailto:training@westgrid.ca) the starting times (in the Pacific timezone)
and lengths of all your Zoom sessions, so that we could schedule these and email the details to you and
to all registered participants in your course.
