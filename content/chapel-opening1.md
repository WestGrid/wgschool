### Live session: introduction to Chapel

You can find the introductory PDF slides [here](http://bit.ly/chapeltop).

**Task parallelism** will be split between Days 1 and 2. Try to get as far as you can on Day 1, and then
resume on Day 2. In this chapter (task parallelism) I suggest skipping *"Parallelizing the heat transfer
equation"* section at the end to save time. Until then we cover the major concepts in task parallelism.

Try to do all exercises in the lessons. The solutions are posted at the end of each page.
