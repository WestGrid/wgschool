These are live debugging sessions for software installation for all courses. If you have a software
installation problem please attend one of these sessions, and we will debug your (or someone else's
similar) problem live via screen sharing in Zoom. Examples:

* installing and running MobaXterm in Windows
* installing and running ParaView on any operating system

Only participants with technical difficulties should attend these sessions. Be prepared to share your
screen if you requre assistance: it will help us help you and help others with similar issues.

You will need to register for one of the summer school courses to receive the Zoom details for these
sessions.

## SSH connection problems

If you are trying to ssh into the training cluster and you get one of these errors

- *"Permission denied, please try again"*
- *"Network error: Connection timed out"*
- *"Connection refused"*

and you are 100% certain that you type the password correctly, we might need to check if your IP address
is blocked on too many attempts to log in. Please go to https://whatismyipaddress.com and tell us your
IPv4 address so that we could whitelist it.
