Session 1: starts at **9am Pacific**, Monday May-25.

Session 2: starts at **12pm Pacific**, Monday May-25.

These are live debugging sessions for software installation for all courses. If you have a software
installation problem that is not unique to a single course please attend one of these sessions, and we
will debug your (or someone else's similar) problem live via screen sharing in Zoom. Examples:

* installing and running MobaXterm in Windows

Only participants with technical difficulties should attend these sessions. Be prepared to share your
screen if you requre assistance: it will help us help you and help others with similar issues.

You will need to register for one of the summer school courses to receive the Zoom details for these
sessions.
