- Eventbrite registration will open to participants from all WG institutions in late April - early May
  - participants will register for individual courses
- Format: self-paced learning (mix of reading materials, pre-recorded videos, takeaway exercises) and Zoom sessions
- To simplify logistics, we will not have parallel courses (single track)
- Few most popular courses will repeat towards the end
- Zoom sessions:
  - each course will have several short (1-1.5 hours) hands-on sessions
  - their number and length determined by each instructor
  - live debugging sessions (Software Carpentry style) in which all participants are expected to follow
    the instructions and do exercises
  - no registration cap (we considered a cap + repeats, but that would be a nightmare to schedule)
  - tracking attendance: type your name + some small tidbit into the etherpad (or similar), or use
    socrative with names
  <!-- participants can instead register for repeats of the most popular courses -->
  <!-- - if a participant does not cancel at least 48 hours in advance and does not attend a session in full, -->
  <!--   they will forfeit any further online hands-on sessions in this school, with exceptions for the current -->
  <!--   circumstances and network/hardware failures (in these cases have to let us know via email - see email -->
  <!--   wording from Marie from Mar-30) -->
  - will not be recorded
  - links will be advertised only to registered participants
- Requirements for participants:
  - must read/watch dependency materials before each hands-on session
  - must install and test software dependencies before the early software installation meetup, and must
    attend the meetup in case of problems
  - we will not be debugging software installations during the actual hands-on sessions
- Suggestions to participants:
  - be prepared to share your screen for debugging sessions
    - everyone will benefit from your debugging session
  - use a dual-screen setup: presenter's materials on one screen, your workspace on another
  - turn on your video
  - use a good headset/microphone
- We will issue certificate listing the courses each participant has attendeed in-full
  - a participant will need to attend all hands-on sessions in at least one course to get a certificate
<!--   - perhaps get in touch with Phil Richardson (he gave them out last year) -->
