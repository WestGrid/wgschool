- Eventbrite registration link
  - will publish the link in late April - early May
  - open to participants from all WG institutions
  - separate morning and afternoon tracks
  - format: mix of reading materials, pre-recorded videos, takeaway exercises, and Zoom sessions
- To simplify logistics, we will not have parallel courses
- Zoom sessions:
  - each course will have several short (1-1.5 hours) Zoom sessions, their number and length
    determined by each instructor
  - no cap, but participants can instead register for repeats of the most popular courses
  - tracking attendance: type your name + some small tidbit into the etherpad (or similar), or use socrative with names
  - if a participant does not cancel at least 48 hours in advance and does not attend a session in full,
    they will forfeit any further online Zoom sessions in this school, with exceptions for the current
    circumstances and network/hardware failures (in these cases have to let us know via email - see email
    wording from Marie from Mar-30)
  - we will not be recording the Zoom sessions
  - advertise the Zoom session links only to registered participants
  - we will NOT be debugging software installations during the actual Zoom sessions as this will be done in special debugging sessions (see below)
- Debugging sessions:
  - these sessions are not considered part of the actual course and only participants with technical difficulties should attend them
  - be prepared to share your screen during debugging sessions: it will help us help you and help others with similar issues
  - advertise the Debug session links only to registered participants
- Requirements for participants:
  - must read/watch preceding materials before each Zoom session
  - must attend debugging sessions in case of problem with software installation
- Suggestions to participants:
  - use a dual-screen setup if possible: presenter's materials on one screen, your workspace on another
  - turn on your video
  - use a good headset/microphone
- Certificates:
  - we will issue certificates listing the courses each participant has attended in full
  - a course is considered attended in full when a participant attends all Zoom sessions in that course (debugging sessions do not count as Zoom sessions)
<!--   - perhaps get in touch with Phil Richardson (he gave them out last year) -->
