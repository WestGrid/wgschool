- registration link
- dates: last week of May to first week of July
- format: mix of reading materials, pre-recorded videos, takeaway exercises, and hands-on interactive
sessions
  - discussing no-shows and policies
  <!-- - hands-on **option 1:** registration cap (20) for the hands-on sessions with blacklists, many repeats -->
  <!--   of the each session, the number of repeats depends on the registration numbers -- better, but more work -->
  <!-- - hands-on **option 2:** no caps, no repeats (guaranteed poor attendance or harder to debug problems) -->
  - advertise the hands-on session links only to registered participants
- requirements for participants:
  - must read/watch dependency materials before each hands-on session
  - must install and test software dependencies before the early software installation meetup, and must attend the
    meetup in case of problems
- suggestions to participants:
  - be prepared to share your screen for debugging sessions
    - everyone will benefit from your debugging session
  - use a dual-screen setup: presenter's materials on one screen, your workspace on another
  - turn on your video
  - use a good headset/microphone


Instructors will need to determine the number and length of their hands-on sessions.
