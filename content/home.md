(Sessions in bold are fixed in time.)

## Details

- Eventbrite registration will open to participants from all WG institutions in early May
  - participants will register for individual courses
- Format: self-paced learning (mix of reading materials, pre-recorded videos, takeaway exercises) and Zoom sessions
- To simplify logistics, we will not have parallel courses (everything will be in a single track)
- Few most popular courses will repeat towards the end
- Zoom sessions:
  - each course will have several short (1-1.5 hours) hands-on sessions
  - their number and length determined by each instructor
  - live Zoom sessions (Software Carpentry style) in which all participants are expected to follow the
    instructions and do exercises
  - no registration cap (we considered a cap + repeats, but that would be a nightmare to schedule)
  - tracking attendance: type your name + some small tidbit into the etherpad (or similar), or use
    socrative with names
  <!-- participants can instead register for repeats of the most popular courses -->
  <!-- - if a participant does not cancel at least 48 hours in advance and does not attend a session in full, -->
  <!--   they will forfeit any further online hands-on sessions in this school, with exceptions for the current -->
  <!--   circumstances and network/hardware failures (in these cases have to let us know via email - see email -->
  <!--   wording from Marie from Mar-30) -->
  - will not be recorded
  - links will be advertised only to registered participants
  - we will NOT be debugging software installations during the actual Zoom sessions as this will be done
    in special debugging sessions (see below)
- Debugging sessions:
  - these sessions are not considered part of the actual course and only participants with technical
    difficulties should attend them
  - be prepared to share your screen during debugging sessions: it will help us help you and help others
    with similar issues
  - links will be advertised only to registered participants
- Requirements for participants:
  - must read/watch preceding materials before each Zoom session
  - must attend debugging sessions in case of problems with software installation
- Suggestions to participants:
  - use a dual-screen setup if possible: presenter's materials on one screen, your workspace on another
  - turn on your video
  - use a good headset/microphone

## Certificates:
- we will issue certificates listing the courses each participant has attended in full
- a course is considered attended in full when a participant attends and stays active in all Zoom
  sessions in that course (debugging sessions do not count as Zoom sessions)
