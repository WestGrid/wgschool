## Registration

Free Eventbrite registration for individual courses will open to participants from all WestGrid
institutions in early May.

## Format

The format of the school will be self-paced learning (mix of reading materials, pre-recorded videos,
takeaway exercises) and live Zoom sessions with the instructors. To simplify logistics, we will not have
parallel courses -- everything will be in a single track. Few most popular courses will repeat towards
the end (to be scheduled later, based on the registration numbers).

Many courses will have several short (1-1.5 hours) hands-on Zoom sessions; their number and length will
be determined by each instructor. We will not have any registration caps, however, our Zoom sessions will
be limited to 100 participants. We do not expect more than 100 attendees in any single session, however,
to be on the safe side, we suggest logging in a little bit early. The details (room and password) of each
Zoom session will be emailed to registrants in any given course.

Before each course Zoom session, all participants must read/watch the required materials. In Zoom
sessions we will guide participants through a series of hands-on exercises.

Several courses will not follow this format and will be online Zoom lectures without any pre-recorded
materials.

We suggest that all participants use a dual-screen setup if possible: presenter's materials on one
screen, your workspace on another. We also suggest to use a good headset/microphone.

<!-- - tracking attendance: type your name + some small tidbit into the etherpad (or similar), or use socrative with names -->
<!-- - will not be recorded -->

#### Software debugging sessions

Please note that we will NOT be debugging software installations during the actual Zoom sessions as this
will be done in special debugging sessions: several on Monday May-25, and a number of software debugging
sessions for selected courses. If you require assistance with software, please consider attending a
debugging sessions, but please be prepared to share your screen with the problem: it will help us help
you and help others with similar issues. Once again, these debugging sessions are not considered part of
any course, and only participants with technical difficulties should attend them.

## Certificates:

We will issue certificates listing the courses each participant has attended in full. A course is
considered attended in full when a participant attends and participates in all exercises in all Zoom
sessions in that course (debugging sessions do not count).

## Cross-listed UBC workshops

These Core Skill workshops by the UBC Research Commons will be open to all, including participants
outside UBC. The schedule will come very shortly with accompanying registration details.

- Introduction to APIs
- Introduction to the OSF
- Introduction to Web Scraping
