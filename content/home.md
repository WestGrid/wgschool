- Eventbrite registration link
  - will publish the link in late April - early May
  - open to participants from all WG institutions
  - separate morning and afternoon tracks
  - format: mix of reading materials, pre-recorded videos, takeaway exercises, and Zoom sessions
- To simplify logistics, we will not have parallel courses
- Zoom sessions:
  - each course will have several short (1-1.5 hours) Zoom sessions, their number and length
    determined by each instructor
  - no cap, but participants can instead register for repeats of the most popular courses
  - tracking attendance: type your name + some small tidbit into the etherpad (or similar), or use socrative with names
  - if a participant does not cancel at least 48 hours in advance and does not attend a session in full,
    they will forfeit any further online Zoom sessions in this school, with exceptions for the current
    circumstances and network/hardware failures (in these cases have to let us know via email - see email
    wording from Marie from Mar-30)
  - we will not be recording the Zoom sessions
  - advertise the Zoom session and Debug session links only to registered participants
- Requirements for participants:
  - must read/watch dependency materials before each Zoom session
  - must install and test software dependencies before the early software installation meetup, and must
    attend the meetup in case of problems
  - we will not be debugging software installations during the actual Zoom sessions. Instead, there will be special debugging sessions only for those having technical issues
- Suggestions to participants:
  - be prepared to share your screen for debugging sessions
    - everyone will benefit from your debugging session
  - use a dual-screen setup: presenter's materials on one screen, your workspace on another
  - turn on your video
  - use a good headset/microphone
- We will issue certificate listing the courses each participant has attendeed in-full
  - a participant will need to attend all Zoom sessions (with the exclusion of the debugging sessions) in at least one course to get a certificate
<!--   - perhaps get in touch with Phil Richardson (he gave them out last year) -->
