- Eventbrite registration link
  - publish the link
  - open to participants from all WG institutions
  - separate morning and afternoon tracks
- dates: last week of May to first week of July
- format: mix of reading materials, pre-recorded videos, takeaway exercises, and hands-on interactive
  sessions
- hands-on sessions:
  - each course will have several short (~1 hour) hands-on sessions, their number and length determined
    by each instructor
  - cap of 20 participants, but we'll strive to accommodate everyone with repeats
  - tracking attendance: type your name + some small tidbit into the etherpad (or similar), or use socrative with names
  - if a participant does not cancel at least 48 hours in advance and does not attend a session in full,
    they will forfeit any further online hands-on sessions in this school, with exceptions for the current
    circumstances and network/hardware failures (in these cases have to let us know via email - see email
    wording from Marie from Mar-30)
  - we will not be recording the hands-on sessions
  - advertise the hands-on session links only to registered participants
- requirements for participants:
  - must read/watch dependency materials before each hands-on session
  - must install and test software dependencies before the early software installation meetup, and must
    attend the meetup in case of problems
  - we will not be debugging software installations during the actual hands-on sessions
- suggestions to participants:
  - be prepared to share your screen for debugging sessions
    - everyone will benefit from your debugging session
  - use a dual-screen setup: presenter's materials on one screen, your workspace on another
  - turn on your video
  - use a good headset/microphone
- we will issue certificate listing the courses each participant has attendeed in-full
  - a participant will need to attend all hands-on sessions in at least one course to get a certificate
<!--   - perhaps get in touch with Phil Richardson (he gave them out last year) -->
