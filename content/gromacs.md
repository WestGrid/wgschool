title = "Gromacs simulation optimization"
slug = "gromacs"
+++

This is a **1-day** course.

**Instructor**: Olivier Fisette (Univ. of Saskatchewan / WestGrid)

<!-- **Course plan**: -->

**Target audience**: researchers interested in running molecular dynamics simulations with Gromacs

**Level**: beginner (researchers starting to work with Gromacs), but we will talk only about optimizing
your Gromacs simulations, not teaching Gromacs itself

<!-- **Prerequisites**:  -->

<!-- **Software**: All attendees will need a remote secure shell (SSH) client installed on their computer in -->
<!-- order to participate in the course exercises. On Windows we recommend -->
<!-- [the free Home Edition of MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html). On Mac and Linux -->
<!-- computers SSH is usually pre-installed (try typing `ssh` in a terminal to make sure it is there). -->
