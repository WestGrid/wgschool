This is a **3-day** workshop.

<!-- **Course plan**: -->

**Target audience**: general  

**Level**: beginner

<!-- **Prerequisites**:  -->

**Software**: For Parallel MATLAB, all attendees will need a remote secure shell (SSH) client installed
on their computer in order to participate in the course exercises. On Windows we recommend
[the free Home Edition of MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html). On Mac and Linux
computers SSH is usually pre-installed (try typing `ssh` in a terminal to make sure it is there).

Also, please ensure you have the following:

- a [supported browser](https://www.mathworks.com/support/requirements/browser-requirements.html)
- a MathWorks account (if you don't already have one please go [here](https://www.mathworks.com/login)
  to create one)

The Parallel MATLAB session will also introduce submitting MATLAB parallel jobs on Cedar Monday
afternoon. It would be helpful to have a Compute Canada account, but we will also be providing guest
accounts.

<!-- We have some short videos for each of the session, that will be posted shortly. They can be watched -->
<!-- before or during the sessions. At the start of each morning session we will walk folks through logging -->
<!-- into MATLAB as well as downloading the day's workshop material. The afternoon will be spent answering -->
<!-- questions/demos. -->

**Monday (July-06)**  
*"Parallel MATLAB"* with Raymond Norris
<!-- will need guest accounts on Cedar + reservation for this session -->

Please download the PDF slides:
* [Parallel Computing Hands-On Workshop](/slides/matlabParallelComputing.pdf)
* [Scaling MATLAB on Compute Canada](/slides/matlabOnComputeCanada.pdf) (from slide #12 to the end not officially
  supported until the scripts are deployed)

Today we will be submitting jobs to the reservation on Cedar:

```
cd ~/scratch
salloc --account=def-training-wa_cpu --reservation=wgss3-wr_cpu --mem-per-cpu=... --time=... <other_flags>
