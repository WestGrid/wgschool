## Quick overview of parallel programming frameworks

Here we give you a brief overview of various parallel programming tools. Our goal here is not to learn
how to use these tools, but rather tell you at a high level what these tools do, so that you understand
the difference between shared- and distributed-memory parallel programming models and know which tools
you can use for each. Later, in the scheduler session, you will use this knowledge to submit parallel
jobs to the queue.
