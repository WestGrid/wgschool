You have 1h30m of videos to watch today!

Do not try to run remote visualization demos on Cassiopeia training cluster: it is not powerful enough to
do any CPU rendering, and it does not have GPUs. If you have a Compute Canada account, you can try a
small-scale client-server visualization on Cedar, and a large-scale remote visualization only if you feel
ambitious.

For self-practice , I suggest focusing on GUI animation and scripting.
