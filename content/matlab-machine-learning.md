<!-- I’ll be sending over an email from our secure file transfer (SFT) site shortly. The email will contain a -->
<!-- link where you will be able to download the slides and videos for next week’s machine learning / deep -->
<!-- learning sessions. I would appreciate if you are able to upload them to the YouTube channel so that the -->
<!-- links can be posted to the course pages. Please let me know if you don’t receive it—thanks! -->

<!-- Sounds great! Also, when uploading to the YouTube channel, would you be able to upload them as "unlisted" so that only those with the link can view them? -->
